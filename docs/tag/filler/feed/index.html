<p>I just came out of a couple of days of being under the weather. It was a real drag, and I was exhausted! When we heal deep wounds or sickness, often it takes a toll of some sort. It may come at the cost of loss of taste, being bedridden for a bit, and/or lack of social battery and patience.<br>This made me think about the cost of actual healing compared to just recreating or just being reborn. In a repair / healing scenario, the body wants to become whole and resume its orderly function; any imbalances are cured while adding safeguards against future infections.<br>Hold on, wait, this is an E-Sekai blog, isn’t it? How is this relevant?<br>When coming into an E-Sekai, we must realize that a world where we are suddenly dropped into has a lot of history. This is especially true for a world trying to safeguard itself from a previous infection. There are other things that should be considered as well, but all in all, we just need to consider things as they flow, to slowly discover for ourselves a path forward.<br>September is quite the month, to some a lasting, painful memory, to some a time of rebirth and healing. In some situations, a chance for a small miracle. This blog has been all over the place, and I know it doesn’t have any coherence. Must be the medicine still talking, but I wanted to get something out just so I get out of the rut. I promise to do better on the next one.</p>
