<p>Peace is a very sought-after thing. I think it is fair to say that everybody wants peace.<br>Throughout history, there were different ways that “peace” was achieved. Take, for example, power struggles or cold wars. There are different factions that create a “stalemate” to avoid the risk of mass destruction or even complete annihilation.<br>When presented with the option to go against an immovable force or a bigger opponent. What is it that you do? Do you instead create small skirmishes that try to destabilize or just conserve energy and try to negotiate your position? The issue comes when the intention is to dominate or overwhelm the other. Now, take for instance Subaru from Re:Zero. He has the option to just go back and redo all the mistakes that were done. Now, we do not consider the implications and future impacts of war. What matters is the immediate results of what we want. The problem is war of attrition. Now, wars last at most hundreds of years. With the rise of more modern warfare and powerful weapons, it usually just lasts a couple of years.</p>



<p>Peace can be acquired once we know what exactly we are fighting for and are willing to give up and surrender that. When we ask ourselves, is it really worth it? Winning something now and losing in the long run? It could have been that an alliance is formed. It could even be that we lose a lifelong agreement over such trivial matters. What is it that we are fighting for? What is it that you want to achieve? Now, in this E-Sekai world, peace is commonplace because in that world, we can take out from a magic bag infinite amounts of whatever it is that we need. Technology and power can be achieved by divine blessing and opportunity, and everyone is living purposefully. What is peace for you? Aren’t we all after peace that surpasses all understanding? Well, I could at least offer you a peaceful retreat from all the seriousness of this world.</p>
