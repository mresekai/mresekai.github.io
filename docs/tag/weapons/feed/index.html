<p>The modern weapons in isekai are a “cheat skill” and an imbalance. I remember one of the older isekai that I watched was Zero No Tsukaima. I remember that Saito would have access to different weapons and arsenals like a fighter plane. Now you could say that flying mythical beasts and magic could best modern weapons. However, in a fantasy setting, the accuracy and purposely built weapons would cause more damage than magic and incantations. Think of it as one would say “the pen is mightier than the sword,” true in some scenarios but in actual battles, the weapon would win. In the scenario of Saito, however, it was used as a weapon to protect or defend, which is okay, I guess, but in scenarios where it falls into the wrong hands, it becomes a destructive force that the more peaceful people can’t keep up with. All in all, it is an unfair fight; think of it like Boros from One Punch Man invading Earth, and we don’t have Saitama. Totally unfair, and it makes us feel very vulnerable and overwhelmed because we couldn’t defend against it. Now, if all people would have skin that fends off bullets then that would be a different scenario wouldn’t it? I am going beyond the topic now, but I think having these weapons is not bad, but I think limiting it in fantasy scenarios would be good for realistic perspectives.</p>
