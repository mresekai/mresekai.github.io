<p>Why do we dream of a new world? Can&#8217;t we just be satisfied with this one? If we can&#8217;t be satisfied with what we have, can&#8217;t we just try and fix this one? When our horizons get broadened, we often see how things can be and should be. Often times we already have an idea of what is the ideal and what we are settling with. Being content is not bad, however we might fail to see what is &#8220;tolerated&#8221;. Utopian world views are dreams, a perfect design that fits the vision of its creator and everything is in harmony on the other hand a dystopia is the contradiction to that view and there is dissonance instead.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Acceptance and tolerance are two different things, on one hand acceptance is embracing the differences while striving for ideals; on the other hand tolerance allow for the decline of ideals. Often times that is the challenge, especially if there are different ideals. So how do we see the world in a better light if we can only see the decline in to dystopia. That thought lingered through my head as I banged my face against the wall, is it all futile? Honestly, until I was given a new life, I only saw the world through rose colored glasses. I guess its not any different now, its just that I acknowledging that there was a view that I did not really consider. Truly, I cannot change all things nor bend things towards what is ideal, but I can start somewhere, the best place to start is at home and with myself to set in order things within my grasp. Is it possible? Yes! but that requires cooperation from all those around us, we can only do so much and we are often limited in time, so we must build upon things that would last beyond our life time, to be able to say that we have done the right things in pursuit of the ideals that was entrusted onto us.</p>

<p>When you get presented the option on Shrodinger&#8217;s cat scenario would you assume that the cat is alive? Control is deprived from us and delegated to the &#8220;experimenter&#8221;. What if you were in the cat&#8217;s position on the experiment, in this case your life is in the hands of two different people, one a cold judge and the other a person that is completely detached from what happens to you.</p>



<p>Another test is the cookie experiment, here the kids are given a cookie in front of them and the scientist suddenly needs to go somewhere and requests the child to hold off from taking a bite from the cookie. If you were in the child&#8217;s shoes, would you wait or would you eat the cookie.</p>



<p>In both scenarios, there is no clear reward. Our only basis for what to do is what the scientist told us or their &#8220;authority&#8221;. That is hard for anyone, because we do not like giving up control, our view is often limited to something that is tangible, something that we want in the moment. Yet we are still given much freedom in those scenarios, we can roam around the room, we can rest or other we can find something else to pass the time. The focus doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to be on the actual experiment rather we can just do different things so long as we are within certain bounds. Given that on the first thought our choices are dictated by another, would you rebel and choose to not be part of the test? or would you trust that what ever happens it would turn out for the best for you.</p>



<p>I think that certain things require trust especially on 50/50 scenarios when we are given little to no choice. Cliche as it may seem, it would always be good to not focus on the problem but rather what we have control on. Maybe we end up getting punished or rewarded, and there might not be a good solution to it.  In the end, we are still subject to this weird experiment and while others might not agree with me, I think it is best to keep lane and make sure we don&#8217;t mess up the &#8220;work&#8221; that they are doing.</p>

<p>This is quite an interesting topic to think about right now. In the world of plants, there isn&#8217;t usually a need to nurture. What is the natural thing for them to have other creatures like insects pollinate for them and birds or small rodents to spread their seeds. Though in contrast when nurtured, the human would till the soil, sow the seeds, water and help maintain the land they grow in from weeds and other things that would hinder their growth.</p>



<p>The same logic applies for growing a person, we plant the right seeds in their mind and heart, then we nurture them so that they would grow into the person we want them to be. On the flip side of things, we allow nature to take place and just have them learn things for themselves and nothing more, often this way creates a wild growth that could lead to an unintended direction.</p>



<p>This is quite similar to tending to a house or a dungeon or even a pet. Without proper admin or knowledge, these would be neglected and not be up to standard of the owner. Then again often times the owners themselves do not know what it is they want, so we try to present them possibilities and ways to reach the desired goal. Now, we all know that depending on the person viewing the requirements, they all get to imagine a unique outcome to what the owner wants. Having all sorts of ideas can have positive or detrimental effects to the product because we either complicate things or we diverge from the original plan. Thus, sometimes it is good to come back to the owner to check if we are close to what it is that they want.</p>



<p>Eliminating complex things and trying to make sense what the original goal is, helps us figure out if we really need nurture or nature to move things forward.</p>

<p>In Re:Zero, the epitome of &#8220;HERO&#8221; responsibility is the character Subaru. Re:Zero&#8217;s main theme is centered around &#8220;I am responsible for everything that revolves around me&#8221;, here the hero Subaru does not die rather when he does die in the story, it brings him back to a certain point in the story timeline wherein he is free to make different choices from his &#8220;past life&#8221; in order to change the outcomes or just not die in the current iteration.</p>



<p>Though the plot of Re:Zero is a little bit gruesome or romanticized. This kind of thing happens to us on a regular basis. In order to build yourself up then part of you dies, it maybe a bad habit that you give up on or an outdated way of thinking or maybe just choosing a better alternative. Either way, this &#8220;death&#8221; creates a new person, one that tries to do better in order to proceed with his life in meaningful way. This is the healthier, way to improve because it does not try to shift your environment in order to adapt to you rather, we shift our attitudes rather than focusing too much on things that we have little to no impact on. </p>
