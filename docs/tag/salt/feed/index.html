<p>A new world requires a recount of the old one. If we have not experienced the old then we wouldn&#8217;t know what we want with the new. A child is disciplined when we don&#8217;t confirm to what is &#8220;correct&#8221; behavior, however who was it that defined the correct behavior. Why would we act in a certain way when we don&#8217;t have rules in place for our actions. In our world today, often times it is society that dictates what is acceptable and what is not. Comparing it to the old days, we have become more liberated and less concerned with judgement. &#8220;I have done nothing wrong&#8221;, &#8220;What I do does not affect anybody&#8221; or &#8220;everyone else is doing it&#8221; are common ways of thinking nowadays. Completely disregarding past norms, since they had little no benefit anyway. Bending and breaking rules, testing the limits of our new found freedom in order to be &#8220;yourself&#8221;. Innately, nothing wrong with that right? Having individuality makes us unique and experience is the best teacher after all.</p>



<p>Our standards suddenly become miles apart from what we previously had. Was is it really all for free, I mean did we not lose anything in the transition towards this &#8220;new world&#8221;? Like shifting from black and white to colored, new seems to be much better than the old. Often times it is, since I am not typing on a typewriter rather on a laptop computer. This is true for technology, but is it also true for other things? What did we lose in order to get to where we are. Is it really negligible. In all honestly, I don&#8217;t know or maybe I fail to see what I am missing. Maybe all the advancements and the know how somehow overshadow what is sacrificed, or is it that we just fail to notice it because it is too mundane and nuanced.</p>
