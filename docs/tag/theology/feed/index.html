<p>So I was speaking with my dad, the other day about loyalty and the value of it when I thought about how I didn&#8217;t seem to recall reading or hearing &#8220;loyalty&#8221; when reading my KJV bible. I know, I know, you probably are asking why the heck is he talking about religion on this blog. Just so you know that as much as I want to limit or keep conversations here on a certain level, I would often leak some theology here. Anyway back to the topic&#8230;</p>



<p>You would be surprised that there is<strong> no result</strong> when trying to find the word &#8220;loyal&#8221; on a KJV bible. I found this interesting and amusing, considering &#8220;loyal&#8221; should be a common term. If by any chance I am mistaken, please do correct me, I welcome it and would love to see that verse as well. It did occur to me as well that, faithfulness is a more apt word since they technically have the same context and it would be more appropriate in a biblical narrative. Some other thought that I had was that, it might be that loyalty is an offshoot to denote or distinguish faith as more God-centric. I don&#8217;t really have a good reference but according to search results, the word loyalty only came around 1400s thus it might be that there was no direct translation of &#8220;loyalty&#8221; for the Greek language. Anyway quite an interesting find and just thought I could shared here.</p>
