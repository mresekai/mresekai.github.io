<p>On my previous post, I presented the &#8220;Trolley Problem&#8221;. Some people would have bigger &#8220;Market Values&#8221; than others, however if given a choice of saving either a multi-million dollar net-worth person or you own child there is a certain bias toward &#8220;your own&#8221;. Funny how numbers loses its value when presented against an emotional choice.</p>



<p>This is further emphasized with certain things like TCG (trading card games), considering the fact that cards in itself only has the value of the &#8220;art&#8221;, &#8220;rarity&#8221; and usefulness in the card game context. It could be considered card with fancy art. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I have played and I still have certain cards like Magic the Gathering, so the fun factor in is not lost on me. Just trying to stir up your thoughts on the topic at hand.</p>



<p>While I was trying to think of more ideas, it also occurred to me how things loses its worth depending on the situation and time. Given that if a person is in a war situation and food supply is scarce, food would probably have more value. In this situation preservation of life is more important than perceived value. As I was thinking about this it occurred to me that I had a discussion with my mom about fasting and how long a human body can live without food.</p>



<p>Just food for thought I guess, hoping that somehow it fuels the imagination and reaches deep inside.</p>
