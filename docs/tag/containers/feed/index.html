<p>An E Sekai doesn’t need to be out of this world; rather, it can be created within. The easiest way to shift things around is usually by creating something new, to start from scratch and create it in such a way that it aligns with our ideals. Of course, if that is true, then it would mean that future you won’t have a future, so instead of thinking outside the box, we create a box within the box. Within that box, we can build upon things that are meaningful and important to us and our purpose; we make sure that the contents of that box are not easily accessed. Taking responsibility for the security of the box and how it is accessed from within the bigger box. We carefully choose the right people, the right connections, so that it could fulfill its role and purpose. How do we do that? We use core principles to find what matches it. That way, we could live in that small box in the hopes that someday, we could work our way towards a bigger box. Before you know it, we now have a bigger box; it would get messy for sure, some would outgrow the box, some would find familiarity with the box so that maybe in the future we could have a fair share of space within the bigger box and hopefully not lose core things that built that box in the first place.</p>



<p>Anyway, this idea came from the Schrödinger cat experiment, but instead of a cat, we replace the content with a man. The life of the man is in the hands of the one conducting the experiment, unlike the cat, which could not really care for itself. The man could create a safe space for himself within the box and maybe take care of the cat as well. TADA! A small E-Sekai for those within your box. It might be a little bit cramped, but at the very least, there is peace there.</p>
