<p>Would you be okay to die here if you have an option to go to an isekai? Weird comes to mind when thinking about life and purpose. It might be that you are already content here in this world and would rather have a peaceful rest in the afterlife. Maybe you have some unfinished business that you want to achieve here that you want to fulfill in the next world. Either way, dying in this world is hard to think about, especially if you have things that keep you occupied here. Oddly enough, most of the isekai trope is the result of a selfless act of sacrifice of oneself to save another. The good old, jumping in front of a truck to save a crossing child scene. Classic and oddly enough it can still be differentiated in another way. Take for example Rudeus from Mushoku Tensei, while you can say that he willingly sacrificed his life to save another. I think that the action stems out from the meaninglessness of his own life. Contrasting this to a “heroic” act of saving, you could say that the prior is more selfish. Selfish in the sense that it tries to end its own suffering. Much less heroic if perceived that way, though not discounting the life that was saved at the time. It is a perspective of someone that looks with pity for his current situation. I am by no means saying that living that life is not hard, truly if you are someone that is having that kind of struggles please ask for help. There are a lot of places that would gladly help and speak with you without any judgement, please be kind to yourself and seek them out.<br>Back to the topic, I think that there is a certain sacrifice that is more aware/proactive. Much like a soldier that takes a bullet for a civilian, an act of service that seeks the wellbeing of others. I think that there are a lot of people looking for an escape from this world, there is a reason why the isekai genre is popular nowadays. You could wake up one morning and just see everything wrong that is happening in this world, from simple traffic, to gun violence, to global warming. All this could weigh you down and just make you see all the things that are wrong with this world, and yet there is a view that never loses that hope in this broken world.<br>I guess this is sort of an invitation. Before you start thinking about dying to get to an isekai. Why not try to find something that could add a little bit more good in this broken world? That way, you could heal it a bit and truly add purpose to your life.</p>
