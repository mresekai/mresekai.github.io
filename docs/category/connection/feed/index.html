<p>It is a common anime trope to have a dense character in the midst of all the chaos, completely oblivious while still staying positive. This humorous parallel is often true both ways, we can either be super positive of a situation or super negative about a situation. A toxic positive attitude can disqualify what others are experiencing and prevent them from opening up and sharing problems and struggles they currently have. On the other hand if we view things too negatively then we can&#8217;t share successes and celebrate growth. Words are a reflection of the speaker, thus we learn to take in anything and digest it in order to bring life onto our words.</p>



<p>Recognition of someone&#8217;s situation and their truth helps bring out authenticity and prepares us to plant the right thoughts that could bring out the best in people. Situations does not define a person&#8217;s capability to respond properly rather it creates an opportunity to learn to control what we say and do. Grips on reality helps us not fall into the stereotype of the above trope, rather it helps our higher self flow freely which stabilizes our emotions and reactions.</p>

<p>This is quite an interesting topic to think about right now. In the world of plants, there isn&#8217;t usually a need to nurture. What is the natural thing for them to have other creatures like insects pollinate for them and birds or small rodents to spread their seeds. Though in contrast when nurtured, the human would till the soil, sow the seeds, water and help maintain the land they grow in from weeds and other things that would hinder their growth.</p>



<p>The same logic applies for growing a person, we plant the right seeds in their mind and heart, then we nurture them so that they would grow into the person we want them to be. On the flip side of things, we allow nature to take place and just have them learn things for themselves and nothing more, often this way creates a wild growth that could lead to an unintended direction.</p>



<p>This is quite similar to tending to a house or a dungeon or even a pet. Without proper admin or knowledge, these would be neglected and not be up to standard of the owner. Then again often times the owners themselves do not know what it is they want, so we try to present them possibilities and ways to reach the desired goal. Now, we all know that depending on the person viewing the requirements, they all get to imagine a unique outcome to what the owner wants. Having all sorts of ideas can have positive or detrimental effects to the product because we either complicate things or we diverge from the original plan. Thus, sometimes it is good to come back to the owner to check if we are close to what it is that they want.</p>



<p>Eliminating complex things and trying to make sense what the original goal is, helps us figure out if we really need nurture or nature to move things forward.</p>

<p>They say that a strong team is supposedly able to function even without its leader. While all that thought is good and great, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that we should just function without leadership. Humility and trust is built when we understand that the head relies on the body and the body on the head. It gives us space to wrestle while still staying within certain boundaries. Respect is a two way street which is upheld upstream and downstream. A mutual contract that holds us accountable to our actions towards each other. The constant struggle for power and ownership, striving to cover for each others weakness and flaws. We create rules and revise rules in order to cater towards the needs of a team.</p>



<p>Here I present to you the infamous, &#8220;Trolley Problem&#8221; wherein you are forced to choose which people to save. Saving the leader or saving the team. This gives us perspective of reliance, monopoly and choice, what is stopping us from choosing the current one and replacing it with another. No one is irreplaceable, once we grasp this truth then we could give credit where credit is due.</p>

<p>What do you tell a child dying of cancer about this world? What do you tell that child&#8217;s parents? Do you give them the canned response of &#8220;everything happens for a reason&#8221;, or just stay silent until the grief has passed or the pain is through, should the answer be in the form of statistics or math? That the child is but a number in the passing of time? Is it right to show them dreams to numb the pain or rather what kind of truth do you show them? Surely we can tell them that soon we will have a cure for cancer but what if that child is dying tomorrow?</p>



<p>Escaping from the reality of this world, a comfort of things unknown. A child-like fantasy of a world beyond this one, from Peter Pan to Beauty and the Beast, tales create in us a kind of hope that can only be in our imagination, a path forward that never be closed. Somehow, some way this imaginary world provides a direction that goes beyond the time that we have in this planet. When someone is at death&#8217;s door, some would say it is cruel to give them false hope, because this world does not work for people in that way. Maybe if given that one dose of virtual reality, it would given them supernatural strength. That little voice of positivity might just be the one thing they need to move forward and be strong for a miraculous come back.</p>

<p>Hello, greetings to you. It seems that you woke up or was forcibly awakened by some event or circumstance. This post is for you, because now that you are out of your slumber, you might have seen the current state of this world and questioning yourself, &#8220;What now?&#8221;, &#8220;Why even bother?&#8221;, &#8220;What do I do?&#8221; or &#8220;Should I even care?&#8221;.  Maybe you experienced untethered freedom where you can bend and break the rules, following the ethos of &#8220;Rules are meant to be broken.&#8221; only to then be at the tail end of that very belief. If this all sounds and feels familiar, welcome friend, you have come far and might be seeking for answers.</p>



<p>The objective of this very site is to find a way to reach and connect with people that might be feeling lost or just looking for a brethren or a kindred soul. Maybe you have found a secret or gained a unique gift that you want to share with someone. If you have winnowed through different places, websites and people and still couldn&#8217;t find the right connection then this site might just be for you too.</p>
