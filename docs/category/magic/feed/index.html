<p>The modern weapons in isekai are a “cheat skill” and an imbalance. I remember one of the older isekai that I watched was Zero No Tsukaima. I remember that Saito would have access to different weapons and arsenals like a fighter plane. Now you could say that flying mythical beasts and magic could best modern weapons. However, in a fantasy setting, the accuracy and purposely built weapons would cause more damage than magic and incantations. Think of it as one would say “the pen is mightier than the sword,” true in some scenarios but in actual battles, the weapon would win. In the scenario of Saito, however, it was used as a weapon to protect or defend, which is okay, I guess, but in scenarios where it falls into the wrong hands, it becomes a destructive force that the more peaceful people can’t keep up with. All in all, it is an unfair fight; think of it like Boros from One Punch Man invading Earth, and we don’t have Saitama. Totally unfair, and it makes us feel very vulnerable and overwhelmed because we couldn’t defend against it. Now, if all people would have skin that fends off bullets then that would be a different scenario wouldn’t it? I am going beyond the topic now, but I think having these weapons is not bad, but I think limiting it in fantasy scenarios would be good for realistic perspectives.</p>

<p>The thought of destiny can be very beautiful, the thought that we somehow we are meant to be where we are. Is it a random chance? Is it so that we can enjoy life as is? If that is the case, how much control do we really have? What if we were born in the slums or a child from a poor family much more an orphan? Is it still destiny?</p>



<p>Suffering is usually caused by our own mistakes and/or the actions of other people imposed on us, I mean no one wants to suffer right? In life, we don&#8217;t need much, if we have clean water, food and shelter then we are good. It is might not be much of a life, but we are living and we could work our way up towards something better so long as we have a choice and say on it. The problem is when we don&#8217;t have a say or we are limited by situations, it maybe economic, skills, circumstance or access. The problem lies in the part where people impose or force us to move a certain direction I think suffering is part of discontentment of people. Either we think things are unfair, unjust or we think lowly of other people.</p>



<p>I struggled and wrestled with the idea of the unfairness of things, I couldn&#8217;t think clearly on how I would react if I was in the direst of situations. I mean would you blame an orphan about their current situation, and about not doing enough so he/she could get out of his/her situation? Rather we shift the narrative towards ourselves, our own control on things, how can I help, how can we create an environment that help foster a culture of uplifting. Often times we find ourselves powerless and lacking in options even when the intentions are there. Do we just move along and accept that we cannot do anything about things? Of course not instead we take charge of what we can do on our own and progress in our own ways, like joining a group, volunteering, making donations, etc..</p>



<p>So what do you tell an orphan about destiny, I think the right answer is to be prepared. Foster that orphan and tell that orphan that it was destiny that lead you to me. Because something has tugged my heart strings to move in order for me to bring you home. I won&#8217;t have all the answers and I can&#8217;t save all orphans, but I can at least do one small thing in the hopes that others would follow.</p>

<p>If you saw something magical/out of this world and failed to capture it either with video or camera. How do you share it with others? What if it is just a situation like a small drop of rain out of no where, when there is no drizzle or no other source of water in sight. What if God suddenly wants juice while speaking Italian. Outrageous as it may seem certain things cannot be put into words without sounding cuckoo. While thinking about it, I figured you either need to talk with someone wanting to humor you, has a certain level of knowledge or interest in the matter, or have a certain degree of relationship or trust.</p>



<p>It is almost impossible to believe given how things are now. Logic will counter magic any time. There are a lot of ways to do that, like straw-manning. Maybe humoring someone and sticking out until you know someone well enough is the only way to believe. Yet that is still not true, since what they say might not fall the same way for that person or certain situations could cause them to sway towards the opposing view. It is easy to discredit someone about magic, just say its natural and be done with right? Once we know everything about something then there is nothing to it anymore, no mystery and nothing to talk about. It becomes stale and not interesting anymore. Life can be like that sometimes, once you see all the things that life has to offer then there is nothing to it anymore right. Magic can only happen when we willingly go through the process with little to no expectation. It creates space for the spirit of the unknown to move. Instead of us all moving in different directions. Believing in magic is like being a child that is still at home, trusting in everything that their parent says. Until we step out and see the real things behind those stories. What do we then if we get hold of the truth? Do we then use that magic to reveal or do we keep it at the back of our minds that way the magic isn&#8217;t loss?</p>



<p>Magic is something that was hard for me to believe in. Until we see incredible supernatural things, we settle on the shallow parts of magic without getting to the truth behind it. Yes, innocence plays a part but tricky part is remaining to be innocent while knowing the truth behind it all.</p>
