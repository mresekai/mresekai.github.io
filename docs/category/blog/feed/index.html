<p>On my previous post, I presented the &#8220;Trolley Problem&#8221;. Some people would have bigger &#8220;Market Values&#8221; than others, however if given a choice of saving either a multi-million dollar net-worth person or you own child there is a certain bias toward &#8220;your own&#8221;. Funny how numbers loses its value when presented against an emotional choice.</p>



<p>This is further emphasized with certain things like TCG (trading card games), considering the fact that cards in itself only has the value of the &#8220;art&#8221;, &#8220;rarity&#8221; and usefulness in the card game context. It could be considered card with fancy art. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I have played and I still have certain cards like Magic the Gathering, so the fun factor in is not lost on me. Just trying to stir up your thoughts on the topic at hand.</p>



<p>While I was trying to think of more ideas, it also occurred to me how things loses its worth depending on the situation and time. Given that if a person is in a war situation and food supply is scarce, food would probably have more value. In this situation preservation of life is more important than perceived value. As I was thinking about this it occurred to me that I had a discussion with my mom about fasting and how long a human body can live without food.</p>



<p>Just food for thought I guess, hoping that somehow it fuels the imagination and reaches deep inside.</p>

<p>They say that a strong team is supposedly able to function even without its leader. While all that thought is good and great, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that we should just function without leadership. Humility and trust is built when we understand that the head relies on the body and the body on the head. It gives us space to wrestle while still staying within certain boundaries. Respect is a two way street which is upheld upstream and downstream. A mutual contract that holds us accountable to our actions towards each other. The constant struggle for power and ownership, striving to cover for each others weakness and flaws. We create rules and revise rules in order to cater towards the needs of a team.</p>



<p>Here I present to you the infamous, &#8220;Trolley Problem&#8221; wherein you are forced to choose which people to save. Saving the leader or saving the team. This gives us perspective of reliance, monopoly and choice, what is stopping us from choosing the current one and replacing it with another. No one is irreplaceable, once we grasp this truth then we could give credit where credit is due.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What do you tell a child dying of cancer about this world? What do you tell that child&#8217;s parents?

<p>What do you tell a child dying of cancer about this world? What do you tell that child&#8217;s parents? Do you give them the canned response of &#8220;everything happens for a reason&#8221;, or just stay silent until the grief has passed or the pain is through, should the answer be in the form of statistics or math? That the child is but a number in the passing of time? Is it right to show them dreams to numb the pain or rather what kind of truth do you show them? Surely we can tell them that soon we will have a cure for cancer but what if that child is dying tomorrow?</p>



<p>Escaping from the reality of this world, a comfort of things unknown. A child-like fantasy of a world beyond this one, from Peter Pan to Beauty and the Beast, tales create in us a kind of hope that can only be in our imagination, a path forward that never be closed. Somehow, some way this imaginary world provides a direction that goes beyond the time that we have in this planet. When someone is at death&#8217;s door, some would say it is cruel to give them false hope, because this world does not work for people in that way. Maybe if given that one dose of virtual reality, it would given them supernatural strength. That little voice of positivity might just be the one thing they need to move forward and be strong for a miraculous come back.</p>

<p>Hello, greetings to you. It seems that you woke up or was forcibly awakened by some event or circumstance. This post is for you, because now that you are out of your slumber, you might have seen the current state of this world and questioning yourself, &#8220;What now?&#8221;, &#8220;Why even bother?&#8221;, &#8220;What do I do?&#8221; or &#8220;Should I even care?&#8221;.  Maybe you experienced untethered freedom where you can bend and break the rules, following the ethos of &#8220;Rules are meant to be broken.&#8221; only to then be at the tail end of that very belief. If this all sounds and feels familiar, welcome friend, you have come far and might be seeking for answers.</p>



<p>The objective of this very site is to find a way to reach and connect with people that might be feeling lost or just looking for a brethren or a kindred soul. Maybe you have found a secret or gained a unique gift that you want to share with someone. If you have winnowed through different places, websites and people and still couldn&#8217;t find the right connection then this site might just be for you too.</p>
