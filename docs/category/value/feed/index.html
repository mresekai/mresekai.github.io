<p>A new world requires a recount of the old one. If we have not experienced the old then we wouldn&#8217;t know what we want with the new. A child is disciplined when we don&#8217;t confirm to what is &#8220;correct&#8221; behavior, however who was it that defined the correct behavior. Why would we act in a certain way when we don&#8217;t have rules in place for our actions. In our world today, often times it is society that dictates what is acceptable and what is not. Comparing it to the old days, we have become more liberated and less concerned with judgement. &#8220;I have done nothing wrong&#8221;, &#8220;What I do does not affect anybody&#8221; or &#8220;everyone else is doing it&#8221; are common ways of thinking nowadays. Completely disregarding past norms, since they had little no benefit anyway. Bending and breaking rules, testing the limits of our new found freedom in order to be &#8220;yourself&#8221;. Innately, nothing wrong with that right? Having individuality makes us unique and experience is the best teacher after all.</p>



<p>Our standards suddenly become miles apart from what we previously had. Was is it really all for free, I mean did we not lose anything in the transition towards this &#8220;new world&#8221;? Like shifting from black and white to colored, new seems to be much better than the old. Often times it is, since I am not typing on a typewriter rather on a laptop computer. This is true for technology, but is it also true for other things? What did we lose in order to get to where we are. Is it really negligible. In all honestly, I don&#8217;t know or maybe I fail to see what I am missing. Maybe all the advancements and the know how somehow overshadow what is sacrificed, or is it that we just fail to notice it because it is too mundane and nuanced.</p>

<p>This is quite an interesting topic to think about right now. In the world of plants, there isn&#8217;t usually a need to nurture. What is the natural thing for them to have other creatures like insects pollinate for them and birds or small rodents to spread their seeds. Though in contrast when nurtured, the human would till the soil, sow the seeds, water and help maintain the land they grow in from weeds and other things that would hinder their growth.</p>



<p>The same logic applies for growing a person, we plant the right seeds in their mind and heart, then we nurture them so that they would grow into the person we want them to be. On the flip side of things, we allow nature to take place and just have them learn things for themselves and nothing more, often this way creates a wild growth that could lead to an unintended direction.</p>



<p>This is quite similar to tending to a house or a dungeon or even a pet. Without proper admin or knowledge, these would be neglected and not be up to standard of the owner. Then again often times the owners themselves do not know what it is they want, so we try to present them possibilities and ways to reach the desired goal. Now, we all know that depending on the person viewing the requirements, they all get to imagine a unique outcome to what the owner wants. Having all sorts of ideas can have positive or detrimental effects to the product because we either complicate things or we diverge from the original plan. Thus, sometimes it is good to come back to the owner to check if we are close to what it is that they want.</p>



<p>Eliminating complex things and trying to make sense what the original goal is, helps us figure out if we really need nurture or nature to move things forward.</p>

<p>On my previous post, I presented the &#8220;Trolley Problem&#8221;. Some people would have bigger &#8220;Market Values&#8221; than others, however if given a choice of saving either a multi-million dollar net-worth person or you own child there is a certain bias toward &#8220;your own&#8221;. Funny how numbers loses its value when presented against an emotional choice.</p>



<p>This is further emphasized with certain things like TCG (trading card games), considering the fact that cards in itself only has the value of the &#8220;art&#8221;, &#8220;rarity&#8221; and usefulness in the card game context. It could be considered card with fancy art. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I have played and I still have certain cards like Magic the Gathering, so the fun factor in is not lost on me. Just trying to stir up your thoughts on the topic at hand.</p>



<p>While I was trying to think of more ideas, it also occurred to me how things loses its worth depending on the situation and time. Given that if a person is in a war situation and food supply is scarce, food would probably have more value. In this situation preservation of life is more important than perceived value. As I was thinking about this it occurred to me that I had a discussion with my mom about fasting and how long a human body can live without food.</p>



<p>Just food for thought I guess, hoping that somehow it fuels the imagination and reaches deep inside.</p>
