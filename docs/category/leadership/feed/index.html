<p>Who do we trust in times of untruths and unknown unknowns? In a world of E-Sekai, we would come across different ways of interpreting things. When conversations are straightforward, then it is easy to get an answer, but if we want unhindered truth, we often find ourselves walking on eggshells? Why is that? Experiences are truths; no one could ever dispute what you have experienced in your life. However, there are certain things that go beyond our experiences. Discovering truths of the world is like discovering magic in another world; it’s like discovering gravity or the knowledge of how the world operates. Much like when we find a new discovery, we celebrate, we promote, and rejoice in the thing that we uncovered. Trust is like that; when we get to know something about someone, we rejoice and feel special, and the same is true with that person. What if that discovery or special game is now shared with another? Is it still yours? Would the value of the relationship collapse? Not really… because the value of anything is based on the appraiser. Relationships that are built on trust rather than power dynamics are stronger, since there really aren’t any expectations from a trust relationship, which is similar to a pact. Think of it like a child’s relationship with a parent; if it is just output or outcome-based, then surely the child has little to no benefit for the parent. We take care of the other anyway, just because the value of the child isn’t solely based on its output, and that is ultimately subjective.<br>The topic of trust is based on a lot of aspects; we create a space where trust is safe for mutual parties, where even though we say or do something, they won’t take offense; rather, it would be taken as a collaborative ideal, which helps create something positive. Trust is very sensitive, especially for things that are outside our control; it acts like a bank of some sorts; when something is overdrawn, then we demand that trust is reciprocated. The topic in itself is getting out of hand, but let me leave you with a good thought: trusting people in a different environment can be hard, but so long as we can get a common ground on things, I believe that there are always ways to talk things through and gain mutual respect and perspective.</p>

<p>An E Sekai doesn’t need to be out of this world; rather, it can be created within. The easiest way to shift things around is usually by creating something new, to start from scratch and create it in such a way that it aligns with our ideals. Of course, if that is true, then it would mean that future you won’t have a future, so instead of thinking outside the box, we create a box within the box. Within that box, we can build upon things that are meaningful and important to us and our purpose; we make sure that the contents of that box are not easily accessed. Taking responsibility for the security of the box and how it is accessed from within the bigger box. We carefully choose the right people, the right connections, so that it could fulfill its role and purpose. How do we do that? We use core principles to find what matches it. That way, we could live in that small box in the hopes that someday, we could work our way towards a bigger box. Before you know it, we now have a bigger box; it would get messy for sure, some would outgrow the box, some would find familiarity with the box so that maybe in the future we could have a fair share of space within the bigger box and hopefully not lose core things that built that box in the first place.</p>



<p>Anyway, this idea came from the Schrödinger cat experiment, but instead of a cat, we replace the content with a man. The life of the man is in the hands of the one conducting the experiment, unlike the cat, which could not really care for itself. The man could create a safe space for himself within the box and maybe take care of the cat as well. TADA! A small E-Sekai for those within your box. It might be a little bit cramped, but at the very least, there is peace there.</p>

<p>Why do we dream of a new world? Can&#8217;t we just be satisfied with this one? If we can&#8217;t be satisfied with what we have, can&#8217;t we just try and fix this one? When our horizons get broadened, we often see how things can be and should be. Often times we already have an idea of what is the ideal and what we are settling with. Being content is not bad, however we might fail to see what is &#8220;tolerated&#8221;. Utopian world views are dreams, a perfect design that fits the vision of its creator and everything is in harmony on the other hand a dystopia is the contradiction to that view and there is dissonance instead.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Acceptance and tolerance are two different things, on one hand acceptance is embracing the differences while striving for ideals; on the other hand tolerance allow for the decline of ideals. Often times that is the challenge, especially if there are different ideals. So how do we see the world in a better light if we can only see the decline in to dystopia. That thought lingered through my head as I banged my face against the wall, is it all futile? Honestly, until I was given a new life, I only saw the world through rose colored glasses. I guess its not any different now, its just that I acknowledging that there was a view that I did not really consider. Truly, I cannot change all things nor bend things towards what is ideal, but I can start somewhere, the best place to start is at home and with myself to set in order things within my grasp. Is it possible? Yes! but that requires cooperation from all those around us, we can only do so much and we are often limited in time, so we must build upon things that would last beyond our life time, to be able to say that we have done the right things in pursuit of the ideals that was entrusted onto us.</p>

<p>The Pareto Principle, the 80/20 rule, where 20% owns 80% of the wealth. The idea in itself was supposedly applicable in other areas like efficiency, where 80% of the output comes from 20% of the workers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="545" src="http://mresekai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-1024x545.png" alt="" class="wp-image-71" srcset="http://mresekai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-1024x545.png 1024w, http://mresekai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-300x160.png 300w, http://mresekai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-768x408.png 768w, http://mresekai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image.png 1384w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>While this is applicable to certain scenarios, using it as a catch all can be detrimental. My though about this is, in this world we were meant to serve each other and the higher up we are in the chain, then we have a bigger role to play. To be called &#8220;vital&#8221; should not be self serving rather it should serve the interest of the people. The world really isn&#8217;t in an ideal place right now, arguably people shift things towards their advantage. In this world, certain things are needed in order to move things properly and accordingly, this hurts because often times the interest of one view does not justify the interest of other another&#8217;s view. This is similar to what I wrote about earlier in the &#8220;<a href="http://mresekai.com/perception-of-value/" data-type="link" data-id="http://mresekai.com/perception-of-value/">Trolley Problem</a>&#8220;. The &#8220;vital few&#8221; often times need to take care of the own tribe first which can be contradicting to the bigger picture. Power and control also play a part, because often we can be persuaded by different things depending on the situation that we are in.</p>



<p>What happens if we are on the other side of the Pareto principle. Do we just stay still and wait until the 20% dictates what should be done? Maybe yes, if we believe in them even if it complicates all the things in our lives. Maybe no, if we want to move on our own way. In life there are certain boundaries, and we don&#8217;t necessarily have the means to cross those boundaries, I mean chance happens to all of us after-all. I think what matters is what we do with what we have, it doesn&#8217;t mean we don&#8217;t try to broaden our horizons, rather it just means that we hold on to the 20% so that we could better serve the 80%.</p>

<p>As things get more automated and tools lean towards AI, I was wondering earlier there is something we lose in the process. There is no something for nothing in this world and as we move forward in advancements, what was the price that was taken.</p>



<p>I then looked back at how ineffective work turned out for me in the past. These created a lot opportunities for improvement but most of all it created something that we could strive for. Going through processes gave chance to get to know working on the other side. Getting a chance to chat about the work, the trouble of how to get things to move. Asking for small work favors in order to get done in a timely manner. Having heated discussions about how bad current process is and what we could do afterwards. I did grow a lot through the years though, I matured to a point where I came to accept certain things while trying to grasp everything that is still under my control. The thing with effectiveness, is that systems become easier and people come to accept status quo. We find little to nothing to improve thus we become relaxed deferring improvement to the hungrier generation. Often times we neglect the fact that the guidance would be coming from us anyway and most of the time the younger generation still looks up to the ones before.</p>



<p>Work becomes stale, lacking the connection from chance encounters and small talk from asking small favors. We do not get to know the people we are working with and trust fails as soon as we encounter problems. Intention gets misinterpreted and we become more defensive, which causes more disruption than work.</p>



<p>While the results sound so dire, being effective is also part of who we are. Striving and finding ways to make things easier and effective can help us cause less friction in work and creates better opportunities for people inside and outside the company.</p>

<p>When you get presented the option on Shrodinger&#8217;s cat scenario would you assume that the cat is alive? Control is deprived from us and delegated to the &#8220;experimenter&#8221;. What if you were in the cat&#8217;s position on the experiment, in this case your life is in the hands of two different people, one a cold judge and the other a person that is completely detached from what happens to you.</p>



<p>Another test is the cookie experiment, here the kids are given a cookie in front of them and the scientist suddenly needs to go somewhere and requests the child to hold off from taking a bite from the cookie. If you were in the child&#8217;s shoes, would you wait or would you eat the cookie.</p>



<p>In both scenarios, there is no clear reward. Our only basis for what to do is what the scientist told us or their &#8220;authority&#8221;. That is hard for anyone, because we do not like giving up control, our view is often limited to something that is tangible, something that we want in the moment. Yet we are still given much freedom in those scenarios, we can roam around the room, we can rest or other we can find something else to pass the time. The focus doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to be on the actual experiment rather we can just do different things so long as we are within certain bounds. Given that on the first thought our choices are dictated by another, would you rebel and choose to not be part of the test? or would you trust that what ever happens it would turn out for the best for you.</p>



<p>I think that certain things require trust especially on 50/50 scenarios when we are given little to no choice. Cliche as it may seem, it would always be good to not focus on the problem but rather what we have control on. Maybe we end up getting punished or rewarded, and there might not be a good solution to it.  In the end, we are still subject to this weird experiment and while others might not agree with me, I think it is best to keep lane and make sure we don&#8217;t mess up the &#8220;work&#8221; that they are doing.</p>

<p>We all hide behind walls, this is especially true in the day and age of the internet. Identity and hiding behind anonymity gives an edge, much like not showing cards during a poker game, we can bluff, lie and even lead someone on. Although, the knowing that I am talking about here is different, it is when we simply refuse to show our true selves.</p>



<p>It is funny that we often hide ourselves in our emotions. Emotions are for sure part of our personality, but it rarely is who we really are. Think about it, when we speak with someone in anger, what shows up is the spirit of anger. We convey things in a fiery manner and utter words that we come to regret later, but what if we come to a conclusion that anger is part of our personality. It becomes deeply ingrained that we don&#8217;t even notice it. It becomes a justification, that creates a different persona from who we are normally. Severing the connection from our higher self, the one that sees everything from a wider view.</p>



<p>Conversation happens two ways, its either we keep a higher trail of thought or we devolve into the same level as the other. Like water trickling down, we fill conversations with thoughts that helps the discourse to bloom into a meaningful garden of words. It tries to link both head and heart together so we could speak freely and openly about things that satisfies our needs. It gives and it takes, so we do not feel taken advantaged of and we do not feel heavy afterwards. To be lifted up instead of being brought down.</p>



<p>Though as I was thinking through this, I realized that sometimes we also need to go down to the same level in a conversation. A heated discussion can bring out deeper thoughts and concerns that normally won&#8217;t happen in a objective talk. Balancing out the fire with an arbiter and or rules can probably help us create a healthy space to speak out. However, this depends both people respect the rules and bind themselves to them.</p>



<p>Overall, hiding oneself is a defense mechanism&#8230; We just need to learn how to uncover, hidden things or concerns that we have. Being direct requires trust and a certain degree of understanding, knowing who you are speaking with and being attune to certain realities can help build either a beautiful garden or a cold chat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There is currently a common thought nowadays of living dead or people that are alive but are dead in some way shape or form. The idea is leads me to think of how a nihilistic person would view the world today.</p>



<p>Imagine you have a dream, simple yet true and readily achievable, however for some reason, you are unable to push through with it, as if stuck in a rut as all your options slowly dwindle down. Creeping like darkness in dusk, then finally you are in the middle of that abyss with just a lamp as your source of light. Nothing left, except a lamp to comfort you since without it you will be forced to journey in pitch black nothingness with no way to trudge through towards your goal. In my head that is what nihilism is, a swallowing up of all things hoped for, with no other thing left to pursue.</p>



<p>In that meaninglessness, it is easy to find our minds wandering into a spiraling despair. Finding no drive and purpose to this very existence. So now what, how does the other world give meaning to this life? We assume that the other world is true and we should go prepare for it? Ehhh, does that mean I need to save a life so that I can benefit in the next life, the classic save a little girl from dying from a speeding truck so that we could get rewarded in the next life? That could very well be the real meaning of living, how we could save up for the next life.</p>



<p>So should it be a heroic act or an undying self sacrifice? I think it is more than that, its about trying to reach out, trying bring something to the table, trying to fill a role in more that one aspect. Knowing that somehow things will move accordingly and appropriately. Trying to shift purpose in order to fill in the void for another person in the hopes that it will also fill in the missing pieces in our lives and ultimately collect enough credit for the next world. It doesn&#8217;t need to be grand or extravagant, rather it should just fulfill a role that is needed in the right moment.</p>

<p>When looking back in the past, we can always see the frame from a wider view. How things were set in motion because of an action and what we could have done better, what things we can do to improve the current situation. This allows us to make the right decisions and help us to stay grounded since we could not fully grasp the all the possible trajectory of each person. We can only estimate things if a person has unlimited options, thus if we want to come up with a concise decision then we must limit its uses. Think in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Natsuki" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Natsuki">Subaru</a> if he gets limited in one path, on the next revival he chooses a different path, choice is what makes us different from animals, we can always pivot towards another path that is not hindered nor limited. Everything comes at a cost and we must never discount the source of anything because it eventually boils down to one thing anyway. So when deciding on things, we must take into consideration all the factors that are involved, people affected by our decisions, effects of our decisions across time and how it affects the environment that we are currently in. Unfortunately, we have limited scope and view of our world. We can only control what is immediately in front of us and the things within our grasp in our short lifespan, I think we should consider things that helped us get this far and which things we should retain in order to move along the right direction.</p>

<p>This is quite an interesting topic to think about right now. In the world of plants, there isn&#8217;t usually a need to nurture. What is the natural thing for them to have other creatures like insects pollinate for them and birds or small rodents to spread their seeds. Though in contrast when nurtured, the human would till the soil, sow the seeds, water and help maintain the land they grow in from weeds and other things that would hinder their growth.</p>



<p>The same logic applies for growing a person, we plant the right seeds in their mind and heart, then we nurture them so that they would grow into the person we want them to be. On the flip side of things, we allow nature to take place and just have them learn things for themselves and nothing more, often this way creates a wild growth that could lead to an unintended direction.</p>



<p>This is quite similar to tending to a house or a dungeon or even a pet. Without proper admin or knowledge, these would be neglected and not be up to standard of the owner. Then again often times the owners themselves do not know what it is they want, so we try to present them possibilities and ways to reach the desired goal. Now, we all know that depending on the person viewing the requirements, they all get to imagine a unique outcome to what the owner wants. Having all sorts of ideas can have positive or detrimental effects to the product because we either complicate things or we diverge from the original plan. Thus, sometimes it is good to come back to the owner to check if we are close to what it is that they want.</p>



<p>Eliminating complex things and trying to make sense what the original goal is, helps us figure out if we really need nurture or nature to move things forward.</p>
